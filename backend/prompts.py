The output json should follow the schema provided and should split the project summary into title and summary fields.
Make sure to include the project location and year in the title.

    Analyze the resume text and identify where the work experience section begins.
    Return a JSON object with two keys:
    1. 'analysis': Comment on where you think the right substring to split is located at. We will be inserting BEFORE the split substring you identify, so consider that. 
    2. 'start_phrase': The substring to split on

    We will be inserting a new project BEFORE this substring. So think about what substring you would need to identify in order to insert the new project in the right place. New project SHOULD NOT be inserted at the start of the document.
    start_phrase should be long (atleast 5 words). start_phrase should be within same line in the doc, do not join/give multiple lines as start phrase.

          the new project will be inserted above that which is not correct. If i output 'Architect, Fort Meyer Beach, USA 2023', the new project will be inserted above that which is would produce a logical resume with the new project underneath work experience.",
